#### Number: Exercise 1

**Date:** 15/10/2025

**From:** ??

**Objective:** Given an array of int, invert its elements.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time:**O(n) - 
- **Space:**O(n) -

#### Number: Exercise 2

**Date:** 19/10/2025

**From:** LeetCode - 2236 - Root Equals Sum of Children

**Objective:** Given the root of binary tree, return True if the value of the root it equal to the sum of the values of its two children.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: root = [10,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time:**O(1) - 
- **Space:**O(1) -

#### Number: Exercise 3

**Date:** 19/10/2025

**From:** LeetCode - 1480 - Running Sum of 1d Array

**Objective:** Given and array nums, define a running sum of it and return

**Examples:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time:**O(n) - 
- **Space:**O(n) -

#### Number: Exercise 4

**Date:** 20/10/2025

**From:** LeetCode - 1672 - Richest Customer Wealth

**Objective:** Given a list os lists representing the bankary wealth of person, calculate the maximum value for each person and print the highest overall.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time:**O(n^2) - 
- **Space:**O(1) -

#### Number: Exercise 5

**Date:** 21/10/2025

**From:** LeetCode - 412 - Fizz Buzz

**Objective:** Given a int n return an array with n size and with strings based of this conditions 

- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.


**Examples:**

```python
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time:**O(n) - 
- **Space:**O(1) -
